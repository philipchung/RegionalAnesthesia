# Indications

## Indications for Regional Anesthesia

* To avoid inducing general anesthesia, which can cause significant hemodynamic/cardiac & pulmonary consequences.
* To avoid intubation
* Analgesia without affecting neurologic status
* Superior intraoperative & post-operative analgesia compared to IV alone
* Childbirth/Labor Analgesia.  Avoid delivering controlled substances to fetus/newborn.

## Primary vs. Adjunctive vs. Analgesic

|| Primary Regional Anesthetic | Regional + General | Analgesic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What | OR: Sole anesthetic & analgesic for surgery, confined to nerve distribution | OR: Regional for analgesia & blunt surgical stimulus, but patient still needs intubation | Pain control for post-op/floor/ICU patients.
| Example | Hand/Wrist Surgery, Cesarean Section | Thoracotomy, Nephrectomy, Burns Skin Grafting | Rib fractures in frail patient, Rescue Blocks in PACU

## When/Where We Do It

| Location/Timing | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pre-induction | Most blocks.  Usually in PACU by Block Team, sometimes in OR. <li>Patients can be sedated, but are *awake to provide feedback*</li> <li>Minimizes needle injuries & intraneural injections.</li> <li>Patients can cooperate with specific positioning</li> <li>Blocks provide intra-operative analgesia</li>|
| Post-induction | Only if patients already intubated, or cannot tolerate procedure awake (e.g. pediatrics) <li>No patient feedback</li> <li>Limited patient positioning</li>|
| Pre-emergence | Often for skin graft donor site, unknown location/extent of graft harvest pre-operatively|
| Post-emergence | Rescue block.  If pain not controlled in PACU with IV analgesics.|
| ICU | commonly Erector Spinae Block (ESP) or Serratus Anterior for frail rib fracture/surgery  <li>analgesia for broken ribs to assist with tidal volumes & extubation</li> |
| Floor | patient needs to be transported to PACU for procedural monitoring
