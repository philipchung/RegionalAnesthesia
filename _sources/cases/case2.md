# Case 2

35 year old man had a fell while climbing a tree and suffered left trimalleolar ankle fracture.

What kind of anesthetic would you offer?  Choose the best answer(s).

* A. General Anesthesia
* B. Femoral Nerve Block
* C. Popliteal Sciatic Block
* D. Saphenous (Adductor Canal) Nerve Block
* E. Fascia Iliaca Block

```{dropdown} Answer

__A. General Anesthesia + C. Popliteal Sciatic Nerve Block + D. Saphenous Nerve Block__

Popliteal sciatic catheter + saphenous (adductor canal) single-shot for intra-operative & post-operative analgesia.

General anesthesia often desired by surgeons because if they use a thigh tourniquet, it is usually above the level of the block & not covered.  These can also be 3+ hour surgeries and we don't want the patient getting light and accidentally kicking.

__Explanation:__

__A. General Anesthesia:__ Yes, often desired by surgeons.  Note that if surgeons use thigh tourniquet, it will not be covered by our block.

B. Femoral Nerve Block: Could do it, but not necessary.  Saphenous nerve block adequate for ankle without blocking quadriceps muscles.

__C. Popliteal Sciatic Block:__ Yes.  Sciatic nerve covers around 80% circumferentially around ankle.  It misses the medial side of the ankle/leg which is the saphenous distribution.  We often place a catheter for post-operative analgesia in patient.

__D. Saphenous:__ Yes.  Saphenous nerve covers 20% medial side of ankle/leg.  This nerve is often blocked at the adductor canal, which is in thigh, distal to where saphenous splits from femoral nerve.  Often single-shot block, but could also place catheter.

E. Fascia Iliaca Block: No.  This is a high-volume plane block that covers femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, and obturator nerves.  Useful for hip surgery and skin grafting from the thigh, but limited utility for covering ankle.  Would only cover the saphenous distribution for this surgery.

What kind of orders do we need to place after we do the block?  Choose the best answer.

* A. 0.2% Ropivicaine @ 6mL/hr continuous
* B. 0.5% Ropivicaine @ 6mL/hr continuous
* C. 1/8% Bupivicaine @ 15mL bolus q90min
* D. 1/16% Bupiviciane + 2mcg/mL Fentanyl @ 6mL/hr
* E. 2% Lidocaine, 10mL bolus
* F. Test Dose (Lidocaine 1.5% with Epinephrine 5µcg/mL, 3mL bolus)

```{dropdown} Answer

__A. 0.2% Ropivicaine @ 6mL/hr

For peripheral nerve block catheters in which catheter is right next to target nerve, we use constant infusion rate.

__Explanation:__

__A. 0.2% Ropivicaine @ 6mL/hr continuous:__ Best Answer.

B. 0.5% Ropivicaine @ 6mL/hr continuous: Higher concentration ropivicaine is used for surgical block to achieve primary regional anesthetic, but not for analgesic block on floor.

C. 1/8% Bupivicaine @ 15mL bolus q90min: Intermittent bolus dosing is used mainly for plane blocks in which high volume is needed to flood the plane for local anesthetic to reach the nerves, which are along the plane.  This is typically combined with ropivicaine & bupivicaine which has a duration of action of 2-4 hours.

D. 1/16% Bupiviciane + 2mcg/mL Fentanyl @ 6mL/hr: This is our standard epidural infusion.  In the epidural space, opioids have a synergistic effect with local anesthetics.  This is not the case for peripheral nerve blocks.

E. 2% Lidocaine, 10mL bolus: Used to achieve surgical anesthesia via epidural catheter.  Not typically used for nerve blocks.

F. Test Dose (Lidocaine 1.5% with Epinephrine 5µcg/mL, 3mL bolus): Epidural test dose is used to check for intrathecal or intravascular placement of epidural catheter.  Not used in nerve blocks.
