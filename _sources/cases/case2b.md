* B. 0.5% Ropivicaine @ 6mL/hr continuous
* C. 1/8% Bupivicaine @ 15mL bolus q90min
* D. 1/16% Bupiviciane + 2mcg/mL Fentanyl @ 6mL/hr

__A. 0.2% Ropivicaine @ 6mL/hr__

For peripheral nerve block catheters in which catheter is right next to target nerve, we use constant infusion rate.

__Explanation:__

__A. 0.2% Ropivicaine @ 6mL/hr continuous:__ Best Answer.

B. 0.5% Ropivicaine @ 6mL/hr continuous: Higher concentration ropivicaine is used for surgical block to achieve primary regional anesthetic, but not for analgesic block on floor.

C. 1/8% Bupivicaine @ 15mL bolus q90min: Intermittent bolus dosing is used mainly for plane blocks in which high volume is needed to flood the plane for local anesthetic to reach the nerves, which are along the plane.  This is typically combined with ropivicaine & bupivicaine which has a duration of action of 2-4 hours.

D. 1/16% Bupiviciane + 2mcg/mL Fentanyl @ 6mL/hr: This is our standard epidural infusion.  In the epidural space, opioids have a synergistic effect with local anesthetics.  This is not the case for peripheral nerve blocks.

E. 2% Lidocaine, 10mL bolus: Used to achieve surgical anesthesia via epidural catheter.  Not typically used for nerve blocks.

F. Test Dose (Lidocaine 1.5% with Epinephrine 5µcg/mL, 3mL bolus): Epidural test dose is used to check for intrathecal or intravascular placement of epidural catheter.  Not used in nerve blocks.
