# Equipment

## Ultrasound

* most blocks done with linear transducer (15-6MHz)
* for kids/skinny patients, consider using small linear transducer (13-6MHz)
* Some deeper blocks require curvilinear
* phased array transducer generally not used for nerve blocks, more common for TTE

| | Small Linear | Large Linear | Hockey Stick | Curvilinear | Phased Array |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Usage | Peripheral IV, Arterial Line | Nerve Block, Central Line | Same as "small linear" | Abdominal, Deep Structures | Cardiac

### In-Plane vs. Out-of-Plane technique

* most nerve blocks done with in-plane technique
* in-plane technically more challenging to align needle tip & target, but can always visualize needle trajectory & tip

## Single-Shot Block Needles

### Pajunk Sonoplex

* thin 21G needles
* short 50mm vs Long 100mm
* more echogenic, can also be used with nerve stimulator

## Catheters

* more time consuming / technically complex procedure
* catheters known to migrate w/ repositioning
* catheters can leak & this is normal

### Catheter Over Needle Technique (Pajunk E-Cath)

### Catheter Through Needle (Sono-Long)

## Catheter Over Needle vs. Through Needle

![Catheter Through vs. Over Needle](catheter-through-vs-over-needle.jpg)

* __Catheter-over-needle:__ no gap between skin & catheter, less prone to leaking but still possible.  Can seal this with dermabond.
* __Catheter-through-needle:__ after needle withdrawn, small gap around catheter & prone to leakage.  Can seal this with dermabond.
