# Indications

## Indications for Regional Anesthesia

* To avoid inducing general anesthesia, which can cause significant hemodynamic/cardiac & pulmonary consequences.
* To avoid intubation
* Analgesia without affecting neurologic status
* Superior intraoperative & post-operative analgesia compared to IV alone
* Childbirth/Labor Analgesia.  Avoid delivering controlled substances to fetus/newborn.

## Primary vs. Adjunctive vs. Analgesic

|| Primary Regional Anesthetic | Regional + General | Analgesic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What | OR: Sole anesthetic & analgesic for surgery, confined to nerve distribution | OR: Regional for analgesia & blunt surgical stimulus, but patient still needs intubation | Pain control for post-op/floor/ICU patients.
| Example | Hand/Wrist Surgery, Cesarean Section | Thoracotomy, Nephrectomy, Burns Skin Grafting | Rib fractures in frail patient, Rescue Blocks in PACU

## When/Where We Do It

Most blocks are done in PACU by Block Team pre-operatively.

* primary regional
* regional + general

Patients can be sedated, but are awake to provide feedback.  Minimizes needle injuries & intraneural injections.

In some special situations, we may do blocks when patient is unconscious.

pre-induction
post-induction
pre-emergence
post-emergence "rescue" blocks

Floor Blocks:

* Can block in ICU, otherwise, patient needs to be transported to PACU for procedural monitoring
* ICU: commonly Erector Spinae Block (ESP) or Serratus Anterior for elderly rib fracture patients.  Help assist extubation or
